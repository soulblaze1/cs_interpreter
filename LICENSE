Why get out of bed in the morning? What’s the point? Let’s face it, the world is a disaster. As soon as you look at your phone or turn on the TV, there is nothing but news of some impending disaster, an imminent war, and people losing rights. What is the point of your life in all of this insanity? Have you ever thought about it? Why keep breathing? Most people never take a minute to consider it at all.

Many people simply get stuck in a daily cycle. They repeat the same pattern over and over again like a hamster running in a wheel. The days come and go, the sun rises and falls, you’re born, you grow, you get old, then you die. Society screams at you “Go to school, get a job, buy a car, buy a house, have a family!” Okay… then what? When a person finally gets to the point where they’ve ticked off all the boxes society has given to them, they realize it’s all been a façade. The sad fact is that most people will live out this mind numbing pattern and waste away their lives never having accomplished anything meaningful in their life. This is a sad excuse for “living”; in fact, it’s hardly living at all. Most people will simply adopt the cookie cutter pattern that society has laid out for them. It’s an assembly line life. It’s life stuck on the default factory setting. It’s a robotic life.

Most people don’t have any Will of their own and live out terribly unsatisfying lives. A person’s happiness level rises when new and positive experiences are presented. The same experience will get old after awhile. So an unhappy person will try to switch things up in their life, “Maybe a new boyfriend or girlfriend will make me happy, maybe a vacation will do the trick.” It might work for a little while, but it will be only temporary. Their happiness level will drop again, and they will have to do something else to bring it back up, and the cycle will continue.

You have been born into a slave system. This has all been put in place to keep you blind from the truth of reality. This kind of “life” does not fulfill you because it is a lie and an insult to existence. If it did fulfill you, you would not be here reading these words. Hyperianism shatters this illusion and shows that your existence is inherently and intrinsically imbued with purpose. Hyperianism is all about understanding your existence, maximizing your power, and transforming the Universe.

You can live a mundane, average life, and you can be a mundane, average person. You can go to school, get a job, make money, get married, have kids, and party on the weekends until the day you die. But is that really living?

You can “live” like that or you can live a life filled with adventure, thrills, satisfaction, intensity, and discovery. You will find secrets hidden in this reality that you would have thought only existed in a dream. They are there for those with eyes to see. They are there for the strong, the intelligent, the Willed, and the lovers of wisdom. The choice is yours.




Hyperianism is the Grand Unified Theory of Everything that gives you the ability to discover the ultimate truth of reality and to unlock your infinite potential. We will never ask you to believe anything on faith. You should always be engaged in questioning and critical thinking. Hyperianism is 100% based on reason and logic as exemplified and defined by mathematics. The foundation of our system is based on mathematical truths of reason. This means that it is deductively certain. There is no faith, belief, or even probability. It is as objectively true as 1 + 1 = 2.  You don’t have to believe that 1 + 1 = 2; you can know it with complete certainty.  Because Hyperianism is based on these kinds of certain truths, it doesn’t ask you to believe, and it gives you absolute knowledge that you can verify for yourself.

The Principle of Sufficient Reason states that for everything that exists, there exists a sufficient reason why it is thus and not otherwise. In other words, there are no such thing as miracles. For everything that exists, there is a reason why it exists the way that it does. As the philosopher Hegel said, “What is rational is real; And what is real is rational.” The Principle of Sufficient Reason is the ground of our system.

Hyperianism is based on deductive truths and a priori logic. It is a mathematical system. Mathematics shows that reality is not based on matter but instead on living mathematical energy: sine and cosine waves.  You do not live in a physical reality. You live in a reality of Mind, of thought, as defined by mathematical frequency. This is explored in detail in our system for those with the Will to know.




You exist within a grand mathematically generated illusion and you yourself are a mathematical being. Mathematics doesn’t just describe reality—you and your world are literally made of living mathematics. It is the code, the essence of this experience that you are having right now. Once you understand this, you’ll find the secrets of reality and begin to liberate yourself from the material realm. You will be as one who walks out from a dark cave to behold the light for the first time.

Look around you at all the tables and chairs, the plants and animals, the trees and the birds. At first glance, these things may not seem mathematical, but that’s because you’ve fallen under the spell of the human senses. The senses have evolved not to show you the truth of reality but to allow you to survive on this planet.

Take the eyes for example. Look at all the colors around you. Colors help to differentiate one thing from another. What is color? Color is light—that’s all it is. When you’re in a dark room, there’s no color, because there is no light. The only difference between one color and another, red and violet, for example, is the frequency of the light. To talk about frequency is to talk about waves. Frequency is the number of times a wave oscillates. Think carefully on what this really means. Frequency is nothing but information, it is a number. And the only thing that differentiates red from violet, and blue from green, is its frequency, its number. An apple looks red because light strikes the apple, which absorbs every frequency of visible light except red; and since the red light is not absorbed, that light strikes your eye, and you see the apple as red. But remember, red is just a frequency, a number—information. But you experience that number as red.

When you look at the red apple on the brown table next to the silver spoon and the yellow flower, you’re simply looking at different values of information, different numbers. You exist within a complex of information—a field of numbers.  You are immersed in code just like a computer simulation. But your physical senses have evolved such that you experience this code as color. You are swimming in an ocean of numbers. Take a minute to look around you right now at all the colors in the room. They are all simply different frequencies, different numbers.

Everything is made up of waves and frequency—color is frequency, sounds and music are frequency, even matter is transformed frequency. Everything is energy.  Everything is frequency.  Everything is number; these are all the same concepts just from a different perspective. The great philosopher Pythagoras who was the founder of a secret society that taught the hidden mysteries of reality said “Numbers rule the universe,” “All is number,” and “ There is geometry in the humming of the strings. There is music in the spacing of the spheres.”

Mathematics is alive. 1 + 1 = 2 is not about scratch marks on paper.  That is what humans use to symbolize an ontological mathematical operation. These numbers on paper represent, or stand in for, mathematical waves that have actual existence. The people of this world hate mathematics because the truth of mathematics has been hidden from them so that they will remain unaware of the truth of reality and themselves. You have been taught math like someone that has been taught that painting is all about painting fences. When in actuality it can be used to create beautiful masterpieces of expression.

If you’re satisfied with this bullshit world of consumerism, empty Facebook memes, and celebrity gossip, then none of this will matter to you, and frankly we don’t want to have a thing to do with you. Really you’re part of the problem. But if you feel that internal sensation that there is so much more to reality, if you feel the hunger for true satisfaction and knowledge, then pay attention. Wake up. Look around.  See past the illusion, and see the math. You aren’t a collection of dead lifeless matter; you are a living mathematical entity—a Mind—a complex of energy.  And you have an eternal destiny.

Liberals push the narrative that Islamic culture is compatible with modern Western democracies. Extroverts essentially try to evaluate life for themselves and then by how other people currently happen to think. Rational introverts instead go for the substance. Rational introverts already know we're talking about making people content to live with one another - but there are other problems and eventualities to resolve as you try to get there - things like engineering, economics, sociology, and other problems of life.

Are Liberals really saying they expect people in burqas (full-body curtains) are going to be fully accpted in pubs, nightclubs and the rest of mainstream society? Are UK/US men going to become comfortable dating women in burqas? The answer is of course that nobody expects these problems to ever occur. Either everyone constantly accepts the insanity of a theocratic anti-freedom culture, or it will magically just adapt to be more like Westerners'. Liberals want to perceive the good parts of the culture without thinking accurately about how Muslims actually interact with one another and with Jihadists (extroverts want to know about peoples' feelings). Liberals are in complete denial that conservative Muslims all agree the Jihadists are going to paradise when they blow themselves up like in the Manchester bombing. The mainstream is fully dedicated to ignoring all the "introverted" details of life (the reality of homelessness, the reality of underground drug networks, the reality of debt and wealth inequality and widespread dissatisfaction with working life, and the reality of religious cult control).

An intuitive introvert thinking type would tell you that these people can't think forward properly about future consequences (liberals are obsessed with surface presentation, and conservatives are too autistic to have abstract empathy and compassion). That's also why no politician will ever answer that burqa dating question: because they can't tell ahead of time what most people would go with. Do you get how this works now? Do you see it? The framework of thought of the modern world is based on popularity and emotionalism and the damaged human condition's sentimentality, and so now, society is crumbling and falling apart exactly because it's not based on rigorous, certain thinking. The accidental support pillars (good enough education and salaries) are eroding, thus liberalism and conservatism are finally being tested fully. They're getting the limelight. Today's nation model is about stories, drama and poorly designed frameworks of support (no job security, very little free time, very poor balancing of social responsibility between those with time and those without). These are rational introvert problems. The world is not something you analyze by how other people feel. Democracy is extroverted, while Meritocracy is introverted.

Liberals, Conservatives and anarchists invariably fail to identify the key points of problems in the world. What's needed is the increase in confidence in all the brightest most rational individuals in society, all over the world. We need the rational people to speak up, have a platform, and denounce the moronic way the world is run. How dare people on Earth ever elect the most stupid to power?!?! The most stupid systems, and the most nefarious, corrupt individuals who can't think properly? Where are the scientists, engineers, doctors, mathematicians, thinkers, philosophers, teachers, lawyers? Where in government are the economists and sociologists and psychologists? Why do we keep running this freak show where everyone is getting a raw deal? We are here because most people can't figure it out, and they need an extreme amount of  help to figure it out on their own (far too much). The answer is NOT more emotionalism and connectivity of feelings. The answer is to be bold and communicate with the people who stand up and count for something much bigger than feelings. The answer is pure reason, and only pure reason elevates and frees you.

As the reach of Liberalism and Conservatism gets wider and wider, it seems crazier and crazier. However, it's never been too late. It's never been less crazy. We simply need to replace the type of thinking and governing, and then things will change towards a rational direction. The world isn't getting worse (it was always really this bad in terms of mainstream thinking, the real primary thing over resource management, which is not the real cause of anything, it's industrial processes and policies).

Endless amounts of human resources are now geared towards fighting false wars. Liberalism versus Conservatism is yet another false war (they are both losers in terms of rationally analyzing reality and how a nation should be ran; they both oppose the smartest solutions and fear the smartest people in the world). Is it Too Real for you? But thinking about the right things will always show us the way to grasp something higher. Thinking is the only answer. As much as it seems like society will somehow fix itself, the answer is that no amount of magical thinking ever did anything. Comfort, belief, sentimentality -- this has zero worth, while the promotion of the highest thinking has infinite worth. Society needs to adopt the rule of the most intelligent and the most talented and the most rationally compassionate (the nicest people) - this is a fact, not an opinion, because of how all the world's crises now mount and get worse every year (climate issues, the industrial machine, extreme absurd wealth inequality which makes even buying houses impossible).

People don't want to talk numbers all day (how much the NASA budget is compared to the military; how to change the tax system and who will be affected, where, all over society not just for yourself). That's why you need panels of experts to decide how the nation is run. We will never get there by appealing to the emotions and the lowest in people. The Bernie/Corbyn/Ocasio-Cortez model is a valiant effort, but it's not radical far-left enough. It's not inventive or imaginative or bold enough. It's not a thorough denounciation of the insane, predatory-capitalist, psychopathic world we live in where all the homeless and all the poor are living very real, miserable existences all because of the decisions and policies of governments. Practically overnight we could have a wildly different world. All our problems in the political and economic sense stem from electing the wrong people into power: the self-obsessed right-wingers (no tax for the rich as long as they bring business into the country) and the emotion-obsessed left (everyone's feelings trumps the reality of systems, economics, reason, science and psychology and sociology).

99% of Brexit voters knew and still know absolutely nothing about the World Trade Organization, or what it does, or how it works - the same with the EEA, FTAs, the ECJ and so on. A nation's future was decided by feelings and irrational uninformed opinion. It's not specific to Britain - but what Brexit revealed is the type of governing function (neoliberal democracy) which moronically placed a monumentally complex process in the hands of ignorant uninformed voters - which is where decisionmaking becomes gambling. Brexit has revealed for the first time in recent history perhaps, the utter stupidity of the people in charge of the world. Who are these people? Who are the EU unelected politicians, and why don't they ever call out the millionaires who run the UK government cabinet? Why doesn't the BBC mention we have a country ran by millionaires? Why won't the government hire all the best people of the nation; all the smartest experts? Because we haven't got the best people in power, or the best type of government at all. We've got psychopathic, predatory capitalism as an economic model, and a useless type of government to contain it. Most of the world's problems come from electing the wrong people and the wrong type of government into power. Democracy is not an intellectual system, it's a popularity contest system.

It still wouldn't matter even if Brexit was a positive economic impact, or the best decision for Britain to ever make -- the key aspect is the type of government and the type of intelligent behaviour in carrying it out. It's not about the choice if the government is incapable of highly rational, intelligent, super-informed decisionmaking, with wide-sweeping legal powers to radically, thoroughly and decisively transform society. For that we need the future governing model to be about the best experts, thinkers, designers architects and engineers, doctors and nurses, teachers, mathematicians, scientists, lawyers, psychologists, sociologists, and all the rest of life. Politicians must go, they are often liars and they enable the revolving door between big business and politics (just read something like Clinton Cash).

The ignorant and the uninformed are the most dangerous types of people in society because they put the worst people into power. Any truly rational, logical person doesn't agree with putting anyone but the smartest in charge. If you can conceptualize properly what the world is (unlike an animal which can't see itself in the mirror), you support the rule of the intelligent because you recognize the need for intelligent oversight to all the functions of government and society.

https://www.statista.com/chart/11857/the-global-pyramid-of-wealth/

 "The level of financial inequality around the world is staggering. According to a new Credit Suisse report, 45.9 percent of global household wealth is in the hands of just 0.7 percent of the world's population. Those 36 million individuals control a mind-boggling $128.7 trillion, as can be seen from the following the pyramid.

 "Below that, 391 people own $111.4 trillion, 39.7 percent of global wealth, despite accounting for just 7.9 percent of the adult population. The base of the pyramid is the most poignant and it shows how 3.47 billion people (70 percent of the population) share a combined wealth of $7.6 trillion which is just 2.6 percent of total wealth."

What this means in real terms is that the extremely wealthy control the vast bulk of property, land, businesses, resources and have access to education and opportunities that are beyond the reach of the vast majority of individuals. The current phase of global Capitalism could not be more anti meritocratic.
