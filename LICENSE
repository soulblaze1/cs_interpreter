Why get out of bed in the morning? What’s the point? Let’s face it, the world is a disaster. As soon as you look at your phone or turn on the TV, there is nothing but news of some impending disaster, an imminent war, and people losing rights. What is the point of your life in all of this insanity? Have you ever thought about it? Why keep breathing? Most people never take a minute to consider it at all.

Many people simply get stuck in a daily cycle. They repeat the same pattern over and over again like a hamster running in a wheel. The days come and go, the sun rises and falls, you’re born, you grow, you get old, then you die. Society screams at you “Go to school, get a job, buy a car, buy a house, have a family!” Okay… then what? When a person finally gets to the point where they’ve ticked off all the boxes society has given to them, they realize it’s all been a façade. The sad fact is that most people will live out this mind numbing pattern and waste away their lives never having accomplished anything meaningful in their life. This is a sad excuse for “living”; in fact, it’s hardly living at all. Most people will simply adopt the cookie cutter pattern that society has laid out for them. It’s an assembly line life. It’s life stuck on the default factory setting. It’s a robotic life.

Most people don’t have any Will of their own and live out terribly unsatisfying lives. A person’s happiness level rises when new and positive experiences are presented. The same experience will get old after awhile. So an unhappy person will try to switch things up in their life, “Maybe a new boyfriend or girlfriend will make me happy, maybe a vacation will do the trick.” It might work for a little while, but it will be only temporary. Their happiness level will drop again, and they will have to do something else to bring it back up, and the cycle will continue.

You have been born into a slave system. This has all been put in place to keep you blind from the truth of reality. This kind of “life” does not fulfill you because it is a lie and an insult to existence. If it did fulfill you, you would not be here reading these words. Hyperianism shatters this illusion and shows that your existence is inherently and intrinsically imbued with purpose. Hyperianism is all about understanding your existence, maximizing your power, and transforming the Universe.

You can live a mundane, average life, and you can be a mundane, average person. You can go to school, get a job, make money, get married, have kids, and party on the weekends until the day you die. But is that really living?

You can “live” like that or you can live a life filled with adventure, thrills, satisfaction, intensity, and discovery. You will find secrets hidden in this reality that you would have thought only existed in a dream. They are there for those with eyes to see. They are there for the strong, the intelligent, the Willed, and the lovers of wisdom. The choice is yours.




Hyperianism is the Grand Unified Theory of Everything that gives you the ability to discover the ultimate truth of reality and to unlock your infinite potential. We will never ask you to believe anything on faith. You should always be engaged in questioning and critical thinking. Hyperianism is 100% based on reason and logic as exemplified and defined by mathematics. The foundation of our system is based on mathematical truths of reason. This means that it is deductively certain. There is no faith, belief, or even probability. It is as objectively true as 1 + 1 = 2.  You don’t have to believe that 1 + 1 = 2; you can know it with complete certainty.  Because Hyperianism is based on these kinds of certain truths, it doesn’t ask you to believe, and it gives you absolute knowledge that you can verify for yourself.

The Principle of Sufficient Reason states that for everything that exists, there exists a sufficient reason why it is thus and not otherwise. In other words, there are no such thing as miracles. For everything that exists, there is a reason why it exists the way that it does. As the philosopher Hegel said, “What is rational is real; And what is real is rational.” The Principle of Sufficient Reason is the ground of our system.

Hyperianism is based on deductive truths and a priori logic. It is a mathematical system. Mathematics shows that reality is not based on matter but instead on living mathematical energy: sine and cosine waves.  You do not live in a physical reality. You live in a reality of Mind, of thought, as defined by mathematical frequency. This is explored in detail in our system for those with the Will to know.




You exist within a grand mathematically generated illusion and you yourself are a mathematical being. Mathematics doesn’t just describe reality—you and your world are literally made of living mathematics. It is the code, the essence of this experience that you are having right now. Once you understand this, you’ll find the secrets of reality and begin to liberate yourself from the material realm. You will be as one who walks out from a dark cave to behold the light for the first time.

Look around you at all the tables and chairs, the plants and animals, the trees and the birds. At first glance, these things may not seem mathematical, but that’s because you’ve fallen under the spell of the human senses. The senses have evolved not to show you the truth of reality but to allow you to survive on this planet.

Take the eyes for example. Look at all the colors around you. Colors help to differentiate one thing from another. What is color? Color is light—that’s all it is. When you’re in a dark room, there’s no color, because there is no light. The only difference between one color and another, red and violet, for example, is the frequency of the light. To talk about frequency is to talk about waves. Frequency is the number of times a wave oscillates. Think carefully on what this really means. Frequency is nothing but information, it is a number. And the only thing that differentiates red from violet, and blue from green, is its frequency, its number. An apple looks red because light strikes the apple, which absorbs every frequency of visible light except red; and since the red light is not absorbed, that light strikes your eye, and you see the apple as red. But remember, red is just a frequency, a number—information. But you experience that number as red.

When you look at the red apple on the brown table next to the silver spoon and the yellow flower, you’re simply looking at different values of information, different numbers. You exist within a complex of information—a field of numbers.  You are immersed in code just like a computer simulation. But your physical senses have evolved such that you experience this code as color. You are swimming in an ocean of numbers. Take a minute to look around you right now at all the colors in the room. They are all simply different frequencies, different numbers.

Everything is made up of waves and frequency—color is frequency, sounds and music are frequency, even matter is transformed frequency. Everything is energy.  Everything is frequency.  Everything is number; these are all the same concepts just from a different perspective. The great philosopher Pythagoras who was the founder of a secret society that taught the hidden mysteries of reality said “Numbers rule the universe,” “All is number,” and “ There is geometry in the humming of the strings. There is music in the spacing of the spheres.”

Mathematics is alive. 1 + 1 = 2 is not about scratch marks on paper.  That is what humans use to symbolize an ontological mathematical operation. These numbers on paper represent, or stand in for, mathematical waves that have actual existence. The people of this world hate mathematics because the truth of mathematics has been hidden from them so that they will remain unaware of the truth of reality and themselves. You have been taught math like someone that has been taught that painting is all about painting fences. When in actuality it can be used to create beautiful masterpieces of expression.

If you’re satisfied with this bullshit world of consumerism, empty Facebook memes, and celebrity gossip, then none of this will matter to you, and frankly we don’t want to have a thing to do with you. Really you’re part of the problem. But if you feel that internal sensation that there is so much more to reality, if you feel the hunger for true satisfaction and knowledge, then pay attention. Wake up. Look around.  See past the illusion, and see the math. You aren’t a collection of dead lifeless matter; you are a living mathematical entity—a Mind—a complex of energy.  And you have an eternal destiny.
